# black-scholes-optionspricer
This project is a simple yet functional implementation of the Black-Scholes model, a widely used formula for pricing European call and put options. Users can input parameters such as stock price, strike price, volatility, time to maturity, and risk-free interest rate to calculate the theoretical option price.
